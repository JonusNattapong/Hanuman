# Hanuman-o1: Thai Language Reasoning AI Model Architecture Design

## Overview
Hanuman-o1 is a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model specifically designed for Thai language reasoning tasks. The model aims to achieve 100% prediction accuracy on preprocessed datasets through innovative architectural components tailored to Thai linguistic characteristics and advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Thai-Optimized Multi-Head Attention
- **Relative Positional Embeddings**: Custom positional encodings that account for Thai's unique word segmentation (no spaces) and tonal patterns
- **Thai-Specific Attention Heads**: Specialized attention mechanisms that prioritize semantic relationships in Thai compound words and phrases
- **Cross-Lingual Attention**: Hybrid attention layers that can incorporate English reasoning patterns when beneficial

### 2. Reasoning Layers
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Integration**: Built-in CoT processing layers that generate intermediate reasoning steps
- **Logical Inference Module**: Dedicated transformer blocks for logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, implication)
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Attention mechanisms that can trace reasoning paths across multiple sentences

### 3. Thai Language Optimizations
- **Syllable-Aware Tokenization**: Tokenizer that preserves Thai syllable structure for better semantic understanding
- **Tone Preservation**: Embeddings that maintain tonal information crucial for Thai meaning
- **Zero-Shot Reasoning Transfer**: Architecture designed to transfer reasoning capabilities across Thai domains
